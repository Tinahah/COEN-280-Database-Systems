# COEN-280-Database-Systems
Background:
This a course project to develop a data analysis application for Yelp.com’s business review data. The emphasis is on the database infrastructure of the application.

In 2013, Yelp.com has announced the “Yelp Dataset Challenge” and invited students to use this data in an innovative way and break ground in research. In this project you would query this dataset to extract useful information for local businesses and individual users.
The Yelp data is available in JSON format. The original Yelp dataset includes 42,153 businesses, 252,898 users, and 1,125,458 reviews from Phoenix (AZ), Las Vegas (NV), Madison (WI) in United States and Waterloo (ON) and Edinburgh (ON) in Canada. (http://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge/). In your project you will use a smaller and simplified dataset. This simplified dataset includes only 20,544 businesses, the reviews that are written for those businesses only, and the users that wrote those reviews.

Regarding the dataset:
    1. The yelp_user.json and yelp_review.json here only keeps 10 records due to uploading size limit.
